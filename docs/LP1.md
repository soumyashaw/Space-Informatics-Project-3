# Task 1 - Scenario Initialization and Finding Best Orbit

## Explanation

The task of finding the best orbit requires us to calculate the data transmission possible being at a particular inclination.

To simplify the estimation, we calculate the total duration the satellite will be able to communicate with the ground station. Of course, the total duration does not count the time it take for synchronization. 

This simplification was possible because the data rate is constant for all satellites and throughout the transmission time. Hence, the total data transmitted is directly proportional to the total transmission time.

The satellite getting the maximum communication duration will in turn, get the maximum data transfer.
